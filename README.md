# Student Tracker

This was initially a lab assignment problem, but I got a bit carried away
and decided to do more than what the question really wanted to learn more
and enjoy myself for a couple of hours during the afternoon. There are 
things I would definitely change, but this is what I came up with while 
keeping my professor's constraints in mind.
